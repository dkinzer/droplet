Droplet [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dkinzer/droplet.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dkinzer/droplet)
=======

The purpose of this module is to serve as an example of how to set up Travis-CI for a drupal module.  I'll use it in a demonstration during a talk at Drupaldelphia 2013.

I've published the [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/dkinzer/setting-up-a-travis-continuous-integration-environment-for-your-drupal-module) for the talk I gave at Drupadelphia at Speaker Deck.
